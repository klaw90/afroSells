## Afro Sells

## Description / Concept

An online marketplace where vendors (strictly of afro descent) can sell their merchandise. Where the merchandise caters to a afro-descending population. The idea is for this to be a safe space where Black businessman and woman can get the exposure that we typically don't receive in the standard business marketplace. The principle is inclusion, not exclusion. This will be similar to a site like AliExpress.
